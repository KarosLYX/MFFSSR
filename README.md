## Introduction

We have implemented our MFFSSR method through the [NAFNet](https://github.com/megvii-research/NAFNet) algorithm framework.  Training and testing are the same as our previous work CVHSSR (https://github.com/AlexZou14/CVHSSR).

- Paper The MFFSSR has been accepted by CVPRW2024, you can read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05497) here.

We have refined the network, and now the model can achieve better performance than the paper.
